# TV Video Converter

## Introduction

Converts videos to a format that is friendly to almost all TVs. Also overlays subtitles (.srt) on the video (useful for old TVs).

## Installing

To install the tool on your system execute:

    make install

To install the dependencies on a Ubuntu system execute:

    make install-deps-ubuntu

Then just execute:

    tv-video-converter <original video filepath> <subtitle filepath> <converted video filepath>

And wait a lot of time :-)
